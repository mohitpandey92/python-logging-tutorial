    "During my PhD days at Boston University, I never bothered to learn how to log errors in Python. When I was testing my code on my local computer, I could simply see the errors on my terminal screen and when I would send my production code to BU's shared computing cluster, it would always save all error messages in a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "I later realized that it's not true for all cloud computing systems. In particular, when I would be running my production code on Amazon Web Server and my python code would crash suddenly without any leaving any error message. I tried printing my error by using python's try, except block but it doesn't save traceback error. This forced me to look better ways to log my errors on my own."
