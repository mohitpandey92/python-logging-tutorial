    "\n",
    "During my PhD days at Boston University, I never bothered to learn how to log errors in Python. When I was testing my code on my local computer, I could simply see the errors on my terminal screen and when I would send my production code to BU's shared computing cluster, it would store all stderr messages in a file as long as I specify it on my <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/system-usage/running-jobs/submitting-jobs/\">qsub job script</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I later realized that it's not true for all cloud computing systems. In particular, when I started running my production code on Amazon Web Server, my python code could crash without leaving any error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first attempt was to use python's `try except` block to save the error message. \n",

This forced me to look better ways to log my errors on my own and then I stumbled onto python's `logging` class. It is an extremely powerful and customizable class. It takes some time to learn how to use it but I feel it's worth the investment. Let's start with a simple example.\n",

By default, Python tracks WARNING and higher levels. This is why `logging.debug` and `logging.info` messages were written to file.\n",
